# Music video maker

This website will let you make music videos by controlling a bunch of dots with your mouse.

## How to use

Use the slider in the top left corner to change the amount of dots on the screen.
As soon as you upload a sound using the upload button, it will give you a second to prepare while it's loading, then it will start playing the song.

To record it, I highly reccomend [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

### Controls

Left click to attract the dots to your mouse and right click to repel them.
